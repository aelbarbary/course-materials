Script for Audio Recording: Introduction and HTML Basics
[Narrator]
One sunny beautiful day in the meadow, Zakariah the Ant and his friend Aliah met under a tree.

SCENE 1
----------------------------------------------------------------

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Cheerful and upbeat]
"Assalamu Alaikum, Aliah! What a beautiful day Allah has blessed us with, Alhamdulillah!"

[Aliah's Voice: Excited and curious]
"Wa Alaikum Assalam, Zakariah! SubhanAllah, it really is! I was just thinking... wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could share all the amazing things Allah has given us with the world?"

SCENE 2

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Enthusiastic]
"That’s a fantastic idea, Aliah! Let’s build a website where we can share our stories and remind everyone to say SubhanAllah for the wonders around them."

[Aliah's Voice: Confused, a bit unsure]
"A website? Umm… what exactly is that?"

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Reassuring and informative]
"Don’t worry, Aliah! A website is like a house on the internet. It’s a place where we can share pictures, stories, and even messages for anyone to see! Think of it as a digital home for our adventures."

The Front-End and Back-End
[Aliah's Voice: Intrigued but puzzled]
"That sounds exciting, Zakariah! But... how do we build it? Where do we even start?"

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Confident, ready to explain]
"Well, every website has two main parts: the front-end and the back-end. Let me break it down for you."

[Narrator]
Zakariah searched the ground for a tree leaf and started drawing on it.

[Zakariah Narrating Example]
"The front-end is what visitors see when they come to our website. It’s all the colors, text, pictures, and buttons they interact with. Think of it like the decorations and furniture inside a house. We’ll use something called HTML to build it."

[Aliah's Voice: Excited realization]
"So the front-end makes the website pretty and user-friendly! That’s awesome! What about the back-end?"

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Playfully mysterious]
"Ah, the back-end is where the real magic happens. It’s like the engine that runs behind the scenes. It handles things like storing our stories, managing visitors’ messages, and keeping everything running smoothly."

[Aliah's Voice: Amazed]
"SubhanAllah! So the front-end is what everyone sees, and the back-end is what keeps it all working!"

[Narrator]
Can you share with Zakariah and Aliah your favorite websites? (5 sec silence to have them think)

[Aliah's Voice: Excited]
"Very interesting! Let’s get started with the front-end!"

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Encouraging]
"Absolutely, Aliah! And to start, we’ll learn about HTML, the building language of every website."

HTML Basics
[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Teaching, patient tone]
"Alright, Aliah. HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language. Hypertext means that websites are linked together through hyperlinks, like tunnels in our ant colony linking the rooms. Markup language means it's used to tell the computer what to show on the screen. Think of it as the grains of sand we use to build our house."

[Aliah's Voice: Curious, leaning in]
"But... how does it work, Zakariah? What do we need to do?"

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Encouraging, explaining]
"Great question! HTML uses something called elements, like headings, paragraphs, and images. These are all elements, and they are written using tags. Tags are like labels that tell the computer the start and end of an element."

[Zakariah asking a question]
"Can you guess the elements and the tags in this code?" (5 sec silence to have them think)

[Zakariah Narrating Example]
"The h1 is a header element, and the p is a paragraph element. Both have a tag to mark the start and the end of them."

[Zakariah asking a question]
"Do you notice anything in common between these tags?" (5 sec silence to have them think)

[Aliah's Voice: Amazed, understanding]
"Ah, I see now! All the tags are starting with a less-than mark < and ending with a greater-than mark >. Also, the closing tag has an additional slash /."

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Agreeing with enthusiasm]
"Exactly, Aliah! You are correct."

Head and Body
[Aliah's Voice: Curious]
"Zakariah, where do we put all these tags? Just anywhere?"

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Correcting gently]
"Not quite, Aliah. Did you know that HTML has a head and a body?"

[Aliah, amazed and joking]
"Really?! Does it have six legs like us too?"

[Zakariah laughing]
"Not yet! Here’s how the HTML is structured, it looks like this."

[Zakariah explaining]
"The DOCTYPE here tells the computer that this is an HTML file. Then the html element here is the root element of the website. It holds everything in it, and as I said before, it consists of two parts: a head and a body!"

[Aliah, focusing]
"Oh, I see! No legs, only head and body. And where do we put our elements? In the head?"

[Zakariah continuing]
"The head element holds information about the website, like the site title, for example. Most of the head is not really visible on the site page; the visible part is the body, and that's why we add the elements we need to show in the body. Like this h1."

Headers
[Aliah asking]
"I have seen this h1 a couple of times now. What is this h1 element?"

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Teaching, patient tone]
"Great observation! The h1 element stands for a 'Heading Level 1.' It’s the biggest and most important heading on your webpage, like the title of a story. There are six levels of headings, from h1 to h6, with h1 being the largest and h6 the smallest."

[Aliah's Voice: Curious and playful]
"So, if h1 is the king of headings, does that make h6 the smallest ant in the colony?"

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Laughing]
"Exactly! And just like in our ant colony, every heading has its role to play. You can use h2 for subheadings, h3 for smaller sections, and so on. Let’s try a quick example:"

[Zakariah Narrating Example]
"Here’s what a webpage might look like with multiple headings. Each heading gets smaller as the number increases. It helps organize content and make it easier to read."

Refer teacher/student to the relevant section in Jupyter Notebook.

[Aliah's Voice: Excited]
"SubhanAllah! This makes everything so neat and organized. What should we do next, Zakariah?"

Adding Text with Paragraphs
[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Teaching, continuing enthusiastically]
"Now that you understand headings, let’s talk about adding regular text to your website. For that, we use the p element, which stands for 'paragraph.'"

[Aliah's Voice: Eager to learn]
"So p is like telling the computer, 'Here’s a chunk of text!'?"

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Confirming]
"Exactly, Aliah! And just like paragraphs in a book, it keeps everything organized and readable. Here’s an example. This will add a block of text to our page."

[Aliah's Voice: Impressed]
"Oh, I see! And we can add as many paragraphs as we want?"

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Nodding, reassuring]
"Absolutely! But remember, the more organized your text is, the easier it will be for visitors to understand your message."

Lists
[Aliah's Voice: Excited and curious]
"Zakariah, can we make a list of all the blessings Allah has given us? I want it to look neat and organized!"

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Smiling, teaching tone]
"Of course! For that, we use lists in HTML. There are two main types of lists: unordered lists and ordered lists."

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Narrating with excitement]
"An unordered list is perfect when the order doesn’t matter, like listing random blessings. It uses bullet points to organize items. Here’s an example. The <ul> tag stands for 'unordered list', and each item is wrapped in <li>, which means 'list item.'"

[Aliah's Voice: Amazed, understanding]
"Oh, I get it! The bullets make it look so clean. But what if we need a list where the order does matter?"

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Teaching tone, encouraging]
"Great question! When the order is important, like steps to perform Wudu, we use an ordered list. It uses numbers instead of bullets. Here's an example. The <ol> tag stands for 'ordered list.' Each step is still a <li>, but now they’re numbered automatically."

[Aliah's Voice: Excited]
"SubhanAllah! This is so useful for organizing instructions or blessings. Can we add images too? That would be amazingggg!"

Images
[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Enthusiastic, explaining]
"Absolutely! We can add images using the <img> tag. It’s like hanging a picture on the wall of our digital house. Here’s how it works."

[Aliah's Voice: Curious, asking]
"And what are these things after the img?"

[Zakariah]
"These are a new thing called attributes. We use them to add more information to the element. Like the src attribute here tells the browser where to find the image file, and the alt attribute provides a description in case the image doesn’t load."

[Aliah's Voice: Curious, asking]
"Oh, I see! So the alt is like a backup plan?"

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Nodding, affirming]
"Exactly! It’s also helpful for people who use screen readers. The description lets them know what the image is about. Now, if we want to control the size of the image, we can add width and height attributes also. This resizes the image to fit perfectly on our page."

[Aliah's Voice: Amazed]
"Wow! With lists and images, our website will look so professional. Let me try them!"

Adding Links
[Aliah's Voice: Curious]
"Zakariah, you mentioned something about links earlier. Can we add tunnels... I mean, links, to connect pages?"

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Excited to teach]
"Yes, links are like tunnels between different rooms in our ant colony. They allow users to jump from one page to another. We use the a element for links. Here’s how it works:
The href is like the address of the other room, and the text between the tags is what users click on."

[Aliah's Voice: Amazed]
"Wow! So clicking the link takes us to a new page? That’s so cool!"

[Zakariah the Ant's Voice: Agreeing, smiling]
"Yes! And we can link to other websites too! Like if we want to add a link to the humans’ Google, we’ll write it like this."

[Aliah's Voice: Joking]
"SubhanAllah, Zakariah! You’re like a walking HTML encyclopedia!"
