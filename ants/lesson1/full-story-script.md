### **Script for Audio Recording: Introduction and HTML Basics**

---
[Narrator]
One sunny beautiful day in the meadow, Andy the Ant and his friend Samy met under a tree.

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Cheerful and upbeat]**  
"Assalamu Alaikum, Samy! What a beautiful day Allah has blessed us with, Alhamdulillah!"

**[Samy's Voice: Excited and curious]**  
"Wa Alaikum Assalam, Andy! SubhanAllah, it really is! I was just thinking... wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could share all the amazing things Allah has given us with the world?"

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Enthusiastic]**  
"That’s a fantastic idea, Samy! Let’s build a website where we can share our stories and remind everyone to say _SubhanAllah_ for the wonders around them."

**[Samy's Voice: Confused, a bit unsure]**  
"A website? Umm… what exactly is that?"

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Reassuring and informative]**  
"Don’t worry, Samy! A website is like a house on the internet. It’s a place where we can share pictures, stories, and even messages for anyone to see! Think of it as a digital home for our adventures."

### **The Front-End and Back-End**

**[Samy's Voice: Intrigued but puzzled]**  
"That sounds exciting, Andy! But... how do we build it? Where do we even start?"

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Confident, ready to explain]**  
"Well, every website has two main parts: the front-end and the back-end. Let me break it down for you."

[Narrator]
Andy searched the ground for a tree leaf and started drawing on it.

**[Andy Narrating Example]**  
"The **front-end** is what visitors see when they come to our website. It’s all the colors, text, pictures, and buttons they interact with. Think of it like the decorations and furniture inside a house. We’ll use something called **HTML** to build it."

**[Samy's Voice: Excited realization]**  
"So the front-end makes the website pretty and user-friendly! That’s awesome! What about the back-end?"

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Playfully mysterious]**  
"Ah, the back-end is where the real magic happens. It’s like the engine that runs behind the scenes. It handles things like storing our stories, managing visitors’ messages, and keeping everything running smoothly."

**[Samy's Voice: Amazed]**  
"SubhanAllah! So the front-end is what everyone sees, and the back-end is what keeps it all working! 

[narrator]
can you share with Andy and Samy your favorite websites?(5 sec silence to have them think )

[Samy's voice: Excited]
"very interesting, Let’s get started with the front-end!"

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Encouraging]**  
"Absolutely, Samy! And to start, we’ll learn about HTML, the building language of every website."

---
### **HTML Basics**

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Teaching, patient tone]**  
"Alright, Samy. HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language. Hypertext means that websites are linked together through hyperlinks, Like tunnels in our ant colony links the rooms. Mark up language means it's used to tell the computer what to show on the screen. Think of it as the grains of sand we use to build our house."

**[Samy's Voice: Curious, leaning in]**  
"But... how does it work, Andy? What do we need to do?"

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Encouraging, explaining]**  
"Great question! HTML uses something called **elements**, like headings, paragraphs and images they are all elements and these elements are written using **tags**. Tags are like labels that tell the computer the start and end of an elemnt."

**[Andy asking a question]**
"Can you guess the elements and the tags in this code?"(5 sec silence to have them think )

**[Andy Narrating Example]**  
"the `h1` is a header element and the `p` is a paragraph element. both has a tag to mark the start an the end of them."

**[Andy asking a question]**
"Do you notice any things in common between these tags?"(5 sec silence to have them think )

**[Samy's Voice: Amazed, understanding]**  
"Ah, I see now! all the tags are starting with a less than mark `<` and ending with a greater than mark `>`. also the closing tag has an additional slash `/` "

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Agreeing with enthusiasm]**  
"Exactly, Samy! you are correct."

---

### **Head and Body**

**[Samy's Voice: Curious]**  
"Andy, where do we put all these tags? Just anywhere?"

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Correcting gently]**  
"Not quite, Samy. Did you know that HTML has a head and a body?"

[Samy amazed and joking]
"Really?! does it have six legs like us too?"

**[Andy laughing]**  
"Not yet, Here’s how the html is structured,  it looks like this"

[Andy explaining]
"The `DOCTYPE`  here tells the computer that this is a html file. Then the `html` element here is the root element of the website. It holds everything in it and as I said before it consists of two parts: a head and a body!"

[Samy Focusing]
"Oh i see! No legs only head and body. and where we but our elements? in the head?"

[Andy continuing]
"The head element holds information about the website like the site title for example. but do you see the ideas in others' head?"

[samy answering]
"No"

[Andy continuing]
"The same goes here as most of the head is not really visible in the site page, the visible part is the body and that's why we add the elements we need to show in the body. Like this `h1`"

### **Headers**

[Samy Asking]
"I have seen this `h1` a couple of times now, What is this `h1` element ?"

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Teaching, patient tone]**  
"Great observation, The `h1` element stands for a 'Heading Level 1'. It’s the biggest and most important heading on your webpage, like the title of a story. There are six levels of headings, from `h1` to `h6`, with `h1` being the largest and `h6` the smallest."

**[Samy's Voice: Curious and playful]**  
"So, if `h1` is the king of headings, does that make `h6` the smallest ant in the colony?"

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Laughing]**  
"Exactly, And just like in our ant colony, every heading has its role to play. You can use `h2` for subheadings, `h3` for smaller sections, and so on. Let’s try a quick example:"

**[Andy Narrating Example]**  
"Here’s what a webpage might look like with multiple headings. Each heading gets smaller as the number increases. It helps organize content and make it easier to read."

**[Samy's Voice: Excited]**  
"SubhanAllah! This makes everything so neat and organized. What should we do next, Andy?"
### **Adding Text with Paragraphs**

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Teaching, continuing enthusiastically]**  
"Now that you understand headings, let’s talk about adding regular text to your website. For that, we use the `p` element, which stands for 'paragraph'."

**[Samy's Voice: Eager to learn]**  
"So `p` is like telling the computer, 'Here’s a chunk of text!'?"

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Confirming]**  
"Exactly, Samy! And just like paragraphs in a book, it keeps everything organized and readable. Here’s an example. This will add a block of text to our page."

**[Samy's Voice: Impressed]**  
"Oh, I see! And we can add as many paragraphs as we want?"

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Nodding, reassuring]**  
"Absolutely, But remember, the more organized your text is, the easier it will be for visitors to understand your message."

### **Lists**

**[Samy's Voice: Excited and curious]**  
"Andy, can we make a list of all the blessings Allah has given us? I want it to look neat and organized!"

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Smiling, teaching tone]**  
"Of course, For that, we use lists in HTML. There are two main types of lists: unordered lists and ordered lists."

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Narrating with excitement]**  
"An **unordered list** is perfect when the order doesn’t matter, like listing random blessings. It uses bullet points to organize items. Here’s an example. The `<ul>` tag stands for 'unordered list', and each item is wrapped in `<li>`, which means 'list item'."

**[Samy's Voice: Amazed, understanding]**  
"Oh, I get it! The bullets make it look so clean. But what if we need a list where the order does matter?"

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Teaching tone, encouraging]**  
"Great question,  When the order is important, like steps to perform Wudu, we use an **ordered list**. It uses numbers instead of bullets. Here's an example. The `<ol>` tag stands for 'ordered list'. Each step is still a `<li>`, but now they’re numbered automatically."

**[Samy's Voice: Excited]**  
"SubhanAllah! This is so useful for organizing instructions or blessings. can we add Images too? That would be amazingggg"

---

### **Images**

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Enthusiastic, explaining]**  
"Absolutely,  We can add images using the `<img>` tag. It’s like hanging a picture on the wall of our digital house. Here’s how it works. "

**[Samy's Voice: Curious, asking]**  
"Where is the closing tag?"

[Andy answering]
"Great observation, the image tag is different as it's  a self closing tag, which means it has the slash in the end of the opening and it has no closing tag."

**[Samy's Voice: Curious, asking]**  
"And what are these things after the `img`?"

[Andy]
"These are a new thing called attributes. we use it to add more information to the element like the `src` attribute here tells the browser where to find the image file, and the `alt` attribute provides a description in case the image doesn’t load."

**[Samy's Voice: Curious, asking]**  
"Oh i see, So the `alt` is like a backup plan?"

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Nodding, affirming]**  
"Exactly, It’s also helpful for people who use screen readers. The description lets them know what the image is about. Now, if we want to control the size of the image, we can add `width` and `height` attributes also, This resizes the image to fit perfectly on our page."

**[Samy's Voice: Amazed]**  
"Wow, With lists and images, our website will look so professional. Let me try them."
### **Adding Links**

**[Samy's Voice: Curious]**  
"Andy, you mentioned something about links earlier. Can we add tunnels... I mean, links, to connect pages?"

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Excited to teach]**  
"Yes, Links are like tunnels between different rooms in our ant colony. They allow users to jump from one page to another. We use the `a` element for links. Here’s how it works.
The `href` is like the address of the other room, and the text between the tags is what users click on."

**[Samy's Voice: Amazed]**  
"Wow! So clicking the link takes us to a new page? That’s so cool!"

**[Andy the Ant's Voice: Agreeing, smiling]**  
"Yes! And we can link to other websites, too, like if we want to add a link to the humans google we will write it like this"

**[Samy's Voice: Joking]**  
"SubhanAllah, Andy! You’re like a walking HTML encyclopedia!"
